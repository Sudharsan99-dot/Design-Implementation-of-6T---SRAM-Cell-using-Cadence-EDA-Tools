# Ex No: 04 - Design & Implementation of 6T SRAM Cell Using Cadence EDA Tools

## Aim
The aim is to design and implement a 6T SRAM (Static Random-Access Memory) cell using Cadence EDA tools and verify its functionality through transient analysis simulation.

## Tools Required

### Cadence EDA Suite
- **Virtuoso Schematic Editor** (for circuit design)
- **Spectre Simulator** (for circuit simulation)

### Process Design Kit (PDK)
- CMOS technology library (45nm node)  

### Computer System
- Minimum **4GB RAM** and a **multi-core processor**

## Procedure:
### 1. Launch Cadence Virtuoso Environment:
   - Open the Cadence Virtuoso tool and set up the working library.
   - Create a new schematic cell view for the 6T SRAM cell design.

### 2. Schematic Design:
   - Select NMOS and PMOS transistors from the library.
   - Construct the 6T SRAM cell with two cross-coupled inverters and access transistors.
   - Connect the wordline (WL), bitlines (BL, BLB), and power supply connections.

### 3. Simulation:
   - Check the design for errors and proceed with simulation.
   - Launch the Analog Design Environment (ADE).
   - Perform transient analysis to verify read and write operations.
   - Set up input stimulus and analyze the output waveform.
